A full stack web app created with React and Django. It is a collaborative music playing app in which a host can create a room to play music and users can join the room. The host of the room can choose to grant play/pause control to the guests. The guests can also vote to skip the song if the number of votes meets the requirement.

Spotify Premium is required to play/pause and skip.

## Improvement made
- allowing direct access to the specified room without join room page
- adjust the UI when no song is playing
- use environment variables to store API credentials instead of plain python code
